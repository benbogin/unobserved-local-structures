# COVR-10

COVR is a synthetic semantic parsing dataset used to evaluate sequence to sequence models for compositional generalization. COVR-10 contains 10 compositional splits, in which each test set contains a particular kind of unseen programs.

ðŸŸ  and ðŸ”µ represent an unseen pair of symbols in a given example. ðŸŸ¤ represents a symbol that was unseen as a first token in the output sequence.

Splits are created using the Synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) [rules](covr/grammar.txt) that have generated this dataset, by holding
out sets of rules that are not seen together during training.

* For details on this splitting method, see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05899) (Appendix B.2).
* You can see the set of unseen grammar rules for each split, along with training and test examples, by clicking on _Details_ for any desired split.
* See [the list of all grammar splits](covr/all_splits.md), which includes splits that were not selected for COVR-10. This list only includes grammar splits and not _n_-LS splits.

-----------------
<sup>1</sup>Average exact match accuracy for BART-Base, BART-Large, T5-Base and T5-Large, fine-tuned (FT) separately on each split (see implementation details in the paper).

<sup>2</sup>Exact match accuracy of GPT-3, engine `text-davinci-002`, using OpenAI API. For each split we evaluated on a subset of 100 test examples. We use in-context learning (ICL): for each test instance, we randomly sample 10 examples from the training set and add their source and target to the prompt. Click on the GPT-3 accuracy to see samples of prompts and outputs. 

<sup>3</sup>Unobserved local structures of size 2 (2-LS), considering only parent-child relations.
