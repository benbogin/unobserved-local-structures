# Split #80
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* boolean -> boolean_single
* ref_attr_or_attribute -> attr_value

### Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
#### ⚫ boolean -> boolean_single ⚫
**The shape of dog is equal to the color of gray square cat that is chasing round white animal that is chasing square cat**
 ```

```
**The number of dog is greater than the number of brown brown cat**
 ```

 ```

```
**There is brown triangle animal that is playing with cat**
 ```
