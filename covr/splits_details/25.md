# Split #25
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* boolean_single -> exists '(' some_ref ')'
* ref -> filter_object

**Combination 2**
* boolean_single -> quantifier '(' some_ref ',' quantifier_condition ')'
* ref -> filter_object

**Combination 3**
* boolean_single -> compare_attribute
* ref -> filter_object

**Combination 4**
* boolean_single -> compare_count
* ref -> filter_object

### Training examples by seen grammar rules
