# Split #2
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* attr_value_or_number -> attr_value
* some_ref -> with_relation_ref

## Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
#### ⚫ some_ref -> with_relation_ref ⚫
