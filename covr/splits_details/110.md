# Split #110
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* some_ref -> with_relation_ref
* ref -> filter_object

## Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
#### ⚫ ref -> filter_object ⚫

 ```

```
#### ⚫ some_ref -> with_relation_ref ⚫
