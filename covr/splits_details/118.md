# Split #118
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* eq -> 'eq'
* boolean -> boolean_single

### Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
#### ⚫ eq -> 'eq' ⚫
**Either the number of cat that is playing with cat is equal to the number of cat that is playing with square animal that is playing with cat or there is triangle cat**
 ```

 ```
and (eq (query_attr [shape] (filter (triangle, filter (round, find (cat)))), white), lt (count (filter (square, find (dog))), 4))
