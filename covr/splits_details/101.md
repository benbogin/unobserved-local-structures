# Split #101
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* number_or_number_objects -> number
* ref_attr_or_attribute -> attr_value

**Combination 2**
* number_or_number_objects -> number_objects
* ref_attr_or_attribute -> attr_value
