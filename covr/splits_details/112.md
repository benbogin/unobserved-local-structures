# Split #112
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* number_or_number_objects -> number
* boolean -> boolean_single

### Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
