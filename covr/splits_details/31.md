# Split #31
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* query_or_count_answer -> query_or_count
* number_objects -> count '(' some_ref ')'

**Combination 2**
* query_or_count_answer -> 'choose' '(' query_or_count ',' attr_value_or_number ',' attr_value_or_number ')'
* number_objects -> count '(' some_ref ')'
