# Split #16
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* some_ref -> with_relation_ref
* number_or_number_objects -> number

**Combination 2**
* some_ref -> with_relation_ref
* number_or_number_objects -> number_objects

## Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
#### ⚫ some_ref -> with_relation_ref ⚫
**What is the number of gray black animal that is playing with black mouse that is chasing dog ?**
 ```
count (with_relation (filter (gray, filter (black, find (animal))), playing with, with_relation (filter (black, find (mouse)), chasing, find (dog))))
```
**Is the shape of dog that is looking at dog gray or round ?**
 ```
choose (query_attr [shape] (with_relation (find (dog), looking at, find (dog))), gray, round)
```
**There is cat that is looking at square white cat that is chasing round square animal**
 ```
exists (with_relation (find (cat), looking at, with_relation (filter (square, filter (white, find (cat))), chasing, filter (round, filter (square, find (animal))))))

 ```
eq (query_attr [color] (with_relation (find (mouse), playing with, with_relation (filter (gray, find (cat)), playing with, find (animal)))), triangle)
```
#### ⚫ number_or_number_objects -> number ⚫
**The number of white gray animal is equal to 2**
 ```
