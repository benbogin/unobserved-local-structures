# Split #90
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* boolean_single -> exists '(' some_ref ')'
* boolean -> boolean_single

## Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
#### ⚫ boolean -> boolean_single ⚫
**The number of gray cat that is playing with cat is equal to 3**
 ```

 ```

```
**The number of dog that is playing with dog that is looking at dog is less than 2**
 ```

```
**Some of dog that is chasing mouse are looking at animal**
 ```

```
#### ⚫ boolean_single -> exists '(' some_ref ')' ⚫
