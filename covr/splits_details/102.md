# Split #102
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* eq -> 'eq'
* number_or_number_objects -> number_objects

### Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
#### ⚫ eq -> 'eq' ⚫
**Either the shape of animal that is chasing black black cat that is chasing square brown cat is equal to gray or there is triangle brown dog**
 ```

```
**Both most of mouse that is chasing animal that is playing with mouse are square and the number of mouse is equal to 4**
 ```
and (most (with_relation (find (mouse), chasing, with_relation (find (animal), playing with, find (mouse))), filter (square, scene ())), eq (count (find (mouse)), 4))
```
**Both most of triangle mouse are looking at animal and the number of triangle square mouse that is chasing black black animal that is playing with cat is equal to 2**
 ```
and (most (filter (triangle, find (mouse)), with_relation (scene (), looking at, find (animal))), eq (count (with_relation (filter (triangle, filter (square, find (mouse))), chasing, with_relation (filter (black, filter (black, find (animal))), playing with, find (cat)))), 2))
```
**Either all of square round animal are looking at dog that is playing with square dog or the color of mouse is equal to the shape of mouse that is chasing triangle cat**
 ```

```
#### ⚫ number_or_number_objects -> number_objects ⚫
