# Split #97
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* eq -> 'eq'
* boolean_single -> exists '(' some_ref ')'

**Combination 2**
* eq -> 'eq'
* boolean_single -> quantifier '(' some_ref ',' quantifier_condition ')'

**Combination 3**
* eq -> 'eq'
* boolean_single -> compare_count

## Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
