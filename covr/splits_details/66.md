# Split #66
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* ref_attr -> 'query_attr' '[' attr_name ']' '(' some_ref ')'
* query_or_count_answer -> 'choose' '(' query_or_count ',' attr_value_or_number ',' attr_value_or_number ')'
