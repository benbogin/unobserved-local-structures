# Split #95
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* query_or_count -> number_objects
* some_ref -> with_relation_ref

**Combination 2**
* query_or_count -> ref_attr
* some_ref -> with_relation_ref

### Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
