# Split #62
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* boolean_pair -> boolean_or
* ref -> filter_object

### Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
#### ⚫ ref -> filter_object ⚫
**What is the number of triangle gray mouse that is looking at mouse that is playing with round dog ?**
 ```
count (with_relation (filter (triangle, filter (gray, find (mouse))), looking at, with_relation (find (mouse), playing with, filter (round, find (dog)))))
```
**Is the number of square dog that is chasing gray dog 4 or 2 ?**
 ```
choose (count (with_relation (filter (square, find (dog)), chasing, filter (gray, find (dog)))), 4, 2)
```
**Some of white mouse are looking at gray black mouse**
 ```
some (filter (white, find (mouse)), with_relation (scene (), looking at, filter (gray, filter (black, find (mouse)))))
```
**Is the shape of triangle round animal triangle or triangle ?**
 ```
choose (query_attr [shape] (filter (triangle, filter (round, find (animal)))), triangle, triangle)
```
#### ⚫ boolean_pair -> boolean_or ⚫
**Either there is mouse or the number of mouse that is looking at mouse that is looking at animal is less than the number of dog that is playing with animal**
 ```
