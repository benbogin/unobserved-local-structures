# Split #50
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* boolean_single -> compare_attribute
* boolean_pair -> boolean_or

**Combination 2**
* boolean_single -> compare_attribute
* boolean_pair -> boolean_and
