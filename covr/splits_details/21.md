# Split #21
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* boolean_single -> exists '(' some_ref ')'
* boolean_pair -> boolean_and

### Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
