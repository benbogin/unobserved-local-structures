## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* boolean_single -> exists '(' some_ref ')'
* number_or_number_objects -> number_objects

**Combination 2**
* boolean_single -> quantifier '(' some_ref ',' quantifier_condition ')'
* number_or_number_objects -> number_objects

**Combination 3**
* boolean_single -> compare_attribute
* number_or_number_objects -> number_objects
