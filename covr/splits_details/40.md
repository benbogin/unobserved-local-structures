# Split #40
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* eq -> 'eq'
* some_ref -> with_relation_ref

## Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
#### ⚫ some_ref -> with_relation_ref ⚫
**What is the color of cat that is looking at triangle animal that is playing with white dog ?**
 ```
query_attr [color] (with_relation (find (cat), looking at, with_relation (filter (triangle, find (animal)), playing with, filter (white, find (dog)))))
```
**What is the color of mouse that is looking at round mouse that is chasing cat ?**
 ```
query_attr [color] (with_relation (find (mouse), looking at, with_relation (filter (round, find (mouse)), chasing, find (cat))))
```
**Is the number of white brown animal that is chasing round triangle cat that is chasing white cat 2 or 3 ?**
 ```
choose (count (with_relation (filter (white, filter (brown, find (animal))), chasing, with_relation (filter (round, filter (triangle, find (cat))), chasing, filter (white, find (cat))))), 2, 3)
```
**Some of triangle cat that is playing with mouse that is chasing brown square animal are gray**
 ```
some (with_relation (filter (triangle, find (cat)), playing with, with_relation (find (mouse), chasing, filter (brown, filter (square, find (animal))))), filter (gray, scene ()))
```
#### ⚫ eq -> 'eq' ⚫
