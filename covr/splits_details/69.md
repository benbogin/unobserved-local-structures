# Split #69
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* attr_value_or_number -> attr_value
* ref -> filter_object

### Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
#### ⚫ ref -> filter_object ⚫
**The number of gray mouse that is looking at gray square cat is equal to the number of triangle round animal that is playing with brown round animal that is chasing dog**
 ```
eq (count (with_relation (filter (gray, find (mouse)), looking at, filter (gray, filter (square, find (cat))))), count (with_relation (filter (triangle, filter (round, find (animal))), playing with, with_relation (filter (brown, filter (round, find (animal))), chasing, find (dog)))))
```
**Both the shape of triangle round cat is equal to white and the number of square dog is less than 4**
 ```
and (eq (query_attr [shape] (filter (triangle, filter (round, find (cat)))), white), lt (count (filter (square, find (dog))), 4))
```
**The number of round dog that is looking at cat is greater than 4**
 ```
gt (count (with_relation (filter (round, find (dog)), looking at, find (cat))), 4)
```

 ```
