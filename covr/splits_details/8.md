# Split #8
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* ref_attr -> 'query_attr' '[' attr_name ']' '(' some_ref ')'
* boolean -> boolean_pair

**Combination 2**
* ref_attr -> 'query_attr' '[' attr_name ']' '(' some_ref ')'
* boolean -> boolean_single

## Training examples by seen grammar rules
