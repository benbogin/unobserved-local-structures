# Split #34
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* some_ref -> with_relation_ref
* answer -> boolean

## Training examples by seen grammar rules
(training examples which contain each of these grammar rules separately)
#### ⚫ some_ref -> with_relation_ref ⚫
**What is the color of square dog that is playing with round black mouse ?**
 ```

**What is the shape of triangle animal that is looking at animal that is chasing gray cat ?**
 ```

```
**Is the number of black square cat that is chasing dog that is looking at dog 3 or 2 ?**
 ```

 ```
