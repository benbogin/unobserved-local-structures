# Split #115
## Unseen combinations of grammar rules
(if an example contains all rules of any of these sets, it will be a test example)

**Combination 1**
* boolean_single -> quantifier '(' some_ref ',' quantifier_condition ')'
* some_ref -> with_relation_ref

## Training examples by seen grammar rules
